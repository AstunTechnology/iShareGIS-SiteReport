iShareGIS SiteReport Plugin
==========================

The SiteReport plugin for iShareGIS allows a user to generate a site report of the current map view. This includes a map and the attribute information of all visible layers within the map window that is then suitable for printing.

Installation
------------

The plugin requires [iShareGIS](http://astuntechnology.com/ishare/modules/ishare-gis/) v5.0 or above.
