iShareGIS SiteReport Plugin
==========================

The SiteReport plugin for iShareGIS allows a user to generate a site report of the current map view. This includes a map and the attribute information of all visible layers within the map window that is then suitable for printing.

Installation
------------

The plugin requires [iShareGIS](http://astuntechnology.com/ishare/modules/ishare-gis/) v5.0 or above.

* Download the plugin files by clicking the "ZIP" button on the [project page](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/iShareGIS-SiteReport)
* Open the zip file and copy the entire iShareGIS-SiteReport-master folder into your plugins folder (Astun\iShareGIS\5.0\WebApps\Web\plugins\) and rename it to SiteReport.
* To enable the plugin edit iShareGIS.xml and add a line for the SiteReport plugin like so: <Plugin>SiteReport</Plugin>
* Thatâ€™s it. You might need to clear the browser cache for the SiteReport button to appear
* The plugin has limited styling. You can add your own styling as you see fit.
